      "The entire concept of E-Cell, PRMIT&R revolves around student-led, startups-ventures founded by students or initiated on college campuses. But you might wonder: Can a college idea ever become a million-dollar company?\n\nThere are numerous examples of college ideas that have evolved into million or even billion-dollar companies. You might be surprised to learn that Google was once just a college idea.\n\nToday, Google is a global tech giant with a market cap of approximately $2.33 trillion and processes over 70% of all online searches worldwide. Yet, it all started as a simple idea on a college campus.\n\nHere's the story of Google, how a college idea became a trillion-dollar empire.\n\nFounded on September 4, 1998, by Stanford University PhD students Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google began as a research project in 1996 called BackRub. In their Stanford dorm room, Page and Brin developed the PageRank algorithm to improve search results, and Google.com officially launched in 1998. The core business web search was monetized through advertising, and the company quickly caught the attention of top investors.\n\nAn initial check for $100,000 from Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim helped jump-start Google, followed by a $25 million venture funding round led by Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital in June 1999. Google went public in 2004 and later restructured under the parent company Alphabet Inc. in 2015.\n\nDo you know of a college idea that turned into a million-dollar success?

      "Ever noticed how organizing a college event feels a lot like running a small startup?\nYou start with nothing but an idea — a small thought that turns into meetings, group chats, endless planning, and the occasional panic.\n\nAt first, it’s just you and a few enthusiastic friends who believe in something that doesn’t exist yet. That’s exactly what founders do. They take a blank page and start building.\n\nFrom deciding the event theme to convincing others to join in, you’re already learning how to sell an idea, build a team, and execute under pressure. You deal with limited budgets, uncertain timelines, and unexpected problems — the same challenges early-stage startups face.\n\nEvery college event has a why behind it — just like a startup has a mission statement. Maybe you wanted to promote innovation, or maybe just create something memorable for your peers. Either way, you’re learning how to turn ideas into reality — and that’s the first lesson of entrepreneurship.",

      "If you’ve ever led a college event, you know this: ideas are easy, people are hard.\n\nThe biggest challenge isn’t planning — it’s managing a team of friends, volunteers, and classmates, all with different levels of motivation (and attendance). You remind someone about deadlines, handle miscommunication, and somehow keep the energy alive.\n\nWelcome to leadership training — startup edition.\n\nYou learn to delegate, communicate, and sometimes just calmly fix things when they fall apart. When a teammate disappears right before the event, or the person in charge of publicity forgets the poster deadline, you’re forced to adapt — not complain.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what founders do. Startups thrive on uncertainty, and leaders hold teams together when things go off-script.\n\nYou also learn empathy. You realize people work differently, and leadership isn’t about control — it’s about direction.",

      "Every college event has that one terrifying moment — when you open the spreadsheet and realize the budget doesn’t balance.\n\nThat’s when you meet your inner finance executive.\n\nYou start estimating expenses, prioritizing needs, and making tough calls: ‘Do we really need those fancy banners?’ or ‘Can we manage refreshments cheaper?’ These aren’t small decisions — they’re lessons in resource management and financial discipline.\n\nRaising sponsorship? That’s fundraising. Convincing a local business or college administration to support you is the same as pitching investors. Managing payments, collecting bills, and keeping track of every rupee? That’s your first real-world cash flow management.\n\nAnd if you’ve ever ended an event with a small surplus, congratulations — you’ve just achieved your first profitable quarter.",

      "The event is over. The banners come down, the group chat goes silent, and suddenly — it’s just… done.\n\nBut here’s the real part no one talks about — this is when the real learning begins.\n\nMaybe things didn’t go as planned. Maybe the turnout was low, or something broke at the last minute. You replay every mistake in your head and wonder, ‘What could we have done better?’\n\nThat reflection — that instinct to improve — is the foundation of the startup mindset.\n\nFounders call it iteration. You call it learning from experience.\nEvery event you organize becomes a case study in what works and what doesn’t — in planning, budgeting, teamwork, and even communication.\n\nFailure doesn’t mean you failed; it means you found one more way not to do something. And the next time? You’ll do it smarter.",
